Title: Stopwatch Embedded System with ATmega32, Six 7-Segment Displays, and External Interrupts

Description:
This embedded system project focuses on creating a stopwatch using the ATmega32 microcontroller, six seven-segment displays, and three external interrupt buttons. The system will allow you to measure time accurately and control the stopwatch functions seamlessly through the use of external interrupt peripherals.

Components:

ATmega32 Microcontroller: The ATmega32, with its rich peripheral set, is an ideal choice for this project, providing the required processing power and flexibility.

Six Seven-Segment Displays: These displays will be used to present hours, minutes, seconds, and tenths of seconds in a clear and readable format.

BCD to 7-Segment Decoder: Utilize BCD to 7-segment decoder ICs, such as 7447 or 74LS47, to drive the seven-segment displays efficiently.

Crystal Oscillator: A crystal oscillator is essential for precise timekeeping, ensuring accurate measurement.

Three Buttons: Implement three external interrupt buttons, which will be used to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.

Resistors and Wiring: Connect all components using appropriate resistors, wires, and connectors.

Functionality:

Start/Stop Button: One button serves as the start/stop control. When pressed, it initiates or halts the stopwatch. The microcontroller records elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and tenths of seconds during this period.

Reset Button: The second button acts as a reset function. Pressing this button sets the stopwatch time back to zero, enabling you to restart the timing process.

Time Display: Elapsed time will be shown on the six seven-segment displays, with BCD to 7-segment decoders translating the microcontroller's BCD data into the appropriate format.

External Interrupts: The three external interrupt buttons are connected to the microcontroller's external interrupt pins, allowing you to trigger actions based on button presses without polling for input continuously.

Accuracy: The crystal oscillator provides precise timekeeping, while the microcontroller manages the time calculations and display multiplexing.
